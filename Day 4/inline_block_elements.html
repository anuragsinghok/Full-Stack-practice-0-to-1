<!-- what are inline elements?
inline elemetns do not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary (jitni space /jagah require hoti hai utni hi lete hai)

what are Block - level elements?
Block - level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default.
they essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves , pushing any content that comes after them to a new line. (jo screen ki puri width lelelte hai) -->
