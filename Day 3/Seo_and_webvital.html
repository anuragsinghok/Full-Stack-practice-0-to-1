<!-- SEO and CORE WEB VITALS in HTML  -->

<!-- Core Web Vitals (most important vitals)
1-> CLS : CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.
A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. (See below for details on how individual layout shift
scores are calculated.)
A burst of layout shifts, known as a session window, is when one or more individual layout shifts occur in rapid succession with less than 1-second in between each shift and a maximum of 5 seconds for the total window duration.
The largest burst is the session window with the maximum cumulative score of all layout shifts within that window.

2-> LCP : What is LCP?
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.
What is a good LCP score?
To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful Paint of 2.5 seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

3-> FID : first inout Delay
What is FID?
FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.
What is a good FID score?
To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First input Delay of 100 milliseconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop Devices. -->
